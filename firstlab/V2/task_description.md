		# Objective: 
    Define a Python class V2, which represents two-dimensional vectors and
		supports the following operations:
		• Create a new vector out of two real numbers: v = V2(1.1, 2.2)
		• Convert a vector to a string (with the __str__ method)
		• Access the components (with the getX and getY methods)
		• Add two V2s to get a new V2 (with add and __add__ methods)
		• Multiply a V2 by a scalar (real or int) and return a new V2 (with the mul
		and __mul__ methods)
